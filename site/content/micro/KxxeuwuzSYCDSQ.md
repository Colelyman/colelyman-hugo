"More often than we like to think, we make choices to do the expedient thing in our own shortsighted self-interest, maybe accompanied by some protest and handwringing in an attempt to distance ourselves from our responsibility, when we do what we know is wrong and leave it up to chance, as if the chance that a wrong might not happen forgives us from allowing for the chance that it will."
